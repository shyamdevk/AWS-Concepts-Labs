## 🧱 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

> A **VPC** is a private, isolated network inside AWS where you can launch and control resources securely.

---

### 🧩 STEP 1 — CREATE A VPC

**CIDR Block:** Defines a range of IP addresses for your VPC and subnets.
🧮 Use calculator: [Subnet Calculator](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html)

#### 🧠 Components of VPC

1. **VPC:** Virtual network to host AWS resources.
2. **Subnets:** Segments of your IP range.

   * **Public Subnet** → Connected to Internet Gateway.
   * **Private Subnet** → No direct Internet access.
3. **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Enables internet connectivity.
4. **Route Table:** Controls traffic routing (to IGW or NAT).

---

### 🧩 STEP 2 — CREATE SUBNETS

* Go to **Subnets tab** → Create subnet.
* Select your VPC.
* Assign name and **CIDR Block**.
* When VPC is created → AWS auto-creates:

  * Main Route Table
  * Network ACL
  * DHCP Options Set
  * Default Security Group

#### ⚠️ Reserved IPs in Subnet

| IP Address | Usage             |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 10.0.0.0   | Network Address   |
| 10.0.0.1   | VPC Router        |
| 10.0.0.2   | DNS Address       |
| 10.0.0.3   | Future Use        |
| 10.0.0.127 | Broadcast Address |

---

### 🌐 STEP 3 — CREATE INTERNET GATEWAY

1. Go to **Internet Gateways tab** → Create IGW
2. Attach to existing VPC via **Actions → Attach to VPC**

---

### 🛣️ STEP 4 — ROUTE TABLE CONFIGURATION

1. Go to **Route Tables**
2. Select your VPC’s route table
3. Add route:

   ```
   Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
   Target: Your Internet Gateway (IGW)
   ```
4. Use **Resource Map** to visualize connections.

---

### 💻 STEP 5 — ATTACH VPC TO EC2

* While launching EC2 instance:

  * Under **Network Settings**, select your VPC & Subnet.
  * Enable Auto-assign Public IP.
  * Assign appropriate Security Group.
  * Launch instance.

---

### 🖥️ STEP 6 — CLI CONNECTION

```bash
ssh -i "C:\Users\shyam\Downloads\Test-Server-Key.pem" ec2-user@67.202.33.11
# If timeout → modify Security Group inbound rules for SSH (port 22)
```

---

### 🔒 STEP 7 — MAKE SUBNET PRIVATE

* Create **new Route Table**.
* Associate only **private subnet** with this new route table.
* Verify via **Resource Map**.

---

### 🔐 STEP 8 — CONNECT TO PRIVATE SERVER

1. SSH into **Public Server** first.
2. Copy your private key content into a file (using `vi`).
3. Save and set permission:

   ```bash
   chmod 700 <keyfile>
   ssh -i <keyfile> ec2-user@<PrivateIP>
   ```

✅ You’re now connected to the private server via public instance.

> ⚠️ Note: Public server must have internet access (IGW route in Route Table).
![Docker Initialization](gg.png)

# ☁️ AWS Networking — NAT, Elastic IP, Firewall, and VPC Peering

> A complete guide to **AWS networking components** including **NAT Gateway**, **Elastic IP**, **NACLs**, **Security Groups**, and **VPC Peering Lifecycle**.  
> Simplified and ready for study or documentation.

---

## 🌐 NAT (Network Address Translation)

In AWS, **NAT** allows instances in a **private subnet** to access the **internet** (for updates, APIs, etc.) without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.

### 💡 Use Case
Private servers can **download updates** via NAT Gateway,  
but **remain inaccessible** from the internet.

---

### ⚙️ Steps to Access Internet from Private Server via NAT

1. Create a **NAT Gateway** from the VPC console  
2. Select your **Public Subnet**  
3. Allocate an **Elastic IP**  
4. Create the **NAT Gateway**  
5. Assign the NAT Gateway to **Private Route Table**  
6. Add a new route:
   - **Destination:** `0.0.0.0/0`
   - **Target:** NAT Gateway

✅ Done! Private instances now have **outbound internet access** without being exposed publicly.

---

## 🌍 Elastic IP (EIP)

An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is a **static, public IPv4 address** that stays permanently allocated to your AWS account.

### 📌 Key Points

- **Static:** Unlike normal public IPs (which change when you stop/start an instance), an EIP **remains the same**.  
- **Re-mappable:** You can detach it from one instance and attach it to another — useful for **failover or recovery**.  
- **Purpose:** Provides a **permanent and consistent** public IP for EC2 instances or other resources.

---

### ⚙️ Steps to Allocate and Manage Elastic IP

1. Go to **VPC → Elastic IPs → Allocate Elastic IP Address**
2. Once allocated → **Actions → Associate Elastic IP**
3. Select the **EC2 instance** and **Save**
4. After use:
   - **Disassociate** the IP  
   - **Release** it from your account  

---

## 🔥 Firewall in VPC

AWS VPC provides **two firewall layers** to control inbound and outbound traffic.

| Firewall Type | Level | Stateful | Description |
|----------------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Network ACL (NACL)** | Subnet-level | ❌ Stateless | Controls subnet traffic using numbered rules |
| **Security Group** | Instance-level | ✅ Stateful | Controls inbound/outbound traffic for EC2 |

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/1.png)
---

## 🧱 Setting Up NACL (Network Access Control List)

### ⚙️ Steps:

1. Go to **VPC → Network ACLs → Create**
2. Select your **VPC**  
3. Under **Subnet Associations**, add the subnet(s) you want  
4. Add **Inbound** and **Outbound** rules (both mandatory)  
5. Remember:
   - Lower **Rule Number** = Higher priority  
   - `*` (asterisk) = Lowest priority
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/2.png)
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/3.png)

6. Outbound traffic should allow **All Traffic** for internet access

> 🚫 Based on the configured rules and ports, the server traffic may be **allowed or denied**.

---

## 🛡️ Setting Up Security Groups

### ⚙️ Steps:

1. Go to **VPC → Security Groups → Create Security Group**
2. Add **Inbound Rules** (Outbound rules are open by default)
  ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/4.png)
4. To attach:
   - EC2 → **Actions → Security → Change Security Groups**
   - Remove the existing group  
   - Add your **new custom Security Group**

✅ Security Groups are **stateful**, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed.

---

## 🔢 Port Numbers

| Type | Range | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Total** | 0 – 65535 | All available ports |
| **Well-known Ports** | 0 – 1023 | Common services (HTTP, SSH, etc.) |
| **Registered Ports** | 1024 – 49151 | User and system applications |
| **Dynamic Ports** | 49152 – 65535 | Private/temporary connections |

---

## 🔁 VPC Peering Connection Lifecycle

Below are the stages of a **VPC Peering Connection** in AWS.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/5.png)


| State | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Initiating-request** | A VPC peering request is created by the requester |
| **Pending-acceptance** | Waiting for the accepter VPC to approve |
| **Active** | Peering successfully established |
| **Provisioning** | Connection setup in progress |
| **Deleting** | Connection is being removed |
| **Deleted** | Peering removed completely |
| **Failed** | Request could not be completed |
| **Expired** | Request not accepted in time |
| **Rejected** | Request denied by the accepter |
| **No longer visible** | Removed from console after failure/rejection |

---

## 🌉 VPC Peering Connection

**Definition:**  
A **VPC Peering Connection** enables **two VPCs** to communicate using **private IP addresses**, making them appear as if they’re on the same internal network.

---

### ⚙️ STEP 1 — Create Two VPCs

1. **VPC A:** Public + Private Subnets  
2. **VPC B:** Private Subnet only  
3. AWS automatically creates:
   - Route Tables  
   - Internet Gateway  
   - Public & Private Subnets  

Example setup:
- **VPC A:** (Public + Private Subnets)  
- **VPC B:** (Private Subnet only)

---

### ⚙️ STEP 2 — Create EC2 Instances

1. Launch **3 EC2 Instances**
   - Instance 1 → VPC A (Public Subnet)
   - Instance 2 → VPC A (Private Subnet)
   - Instance 3 → VPC B (Private Subnet)
     ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/6.png)

2. At this stage, **VPC A** and **VPC B** cannot communicate (no peering yet).

---

### ⚙️ STEP 3 — Create the Peering Connection

1. Go to **VPC → Peering Connections → Create**
2. **Requester:** VPC A (Public + Private)  
   **Accepter:** VPC B (Private only)
3. Once created → Select Peering → **Actions → Accept Request**

---

### ⚙️ STEP 4 — Update Route Tables

- **Private Route Table (VPC A):**
  - Destination: CIDR range of VPC B
  - Target: Peering Connection
    ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/7.png)


- **Private Route Table (VPC B):**
  - Destination: CIDR range of VPC A
  - Target: Peering Connection  
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/8.png)

---

### ⚙️ STEP 5 — Configure Security Groups

- Go to **EC2 → Security → Edit Inbound Rules**
- Add **ICMP (Ping)** rule to allow communication between private instances  
  (used for testing connectivity)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/9.png)

---

### ⚙️ STEP 6 — Verify Connection

From the **Private Instance in VPC A**, test connection to **Private Instance in VPC B:**
![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/10.png)


```bash
ping <Private-IP-of-VPC-B-instance>
````

✅ If ping succeeds, VPC Peering is active and functional.

---

## 🧠 Notes

* VPC Peering **across regions** requires **different key pairs**
* When peering **between AWS accounts**, copy the **VPC ID** of the peer account
* Both accounts must have at least **one public and one private subnet**
* Number of possible Peering Connections:

  ```
  n(n - 1) / 2
  ```

# 🚏 AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) — Complete Guide

> Learn how to use **AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)** to connect multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and regions seamlessly — all from a **central hub**.

---

## 🌐 What is a Transit Gateway?

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/11.png)


**Definition:**  
A **Transit Gateway (TGW)** is a **central hub** that connects multiple **VPCs**, **on-premises networks (via VPN or Direct Connect)**, and even **other AWS accounts**.  
It simplifies complex network architectures by acting as a single routing hub.

> ⚠️ Transit Gateway works **only within the same AWS Region**, but supports **inter-region peering**.

---

## 🕸️ Model: Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

- **Transit Gateway = Hub**  
- **VPCs / On-premises networks = Spokes**

Instead of connecting every VPC to every other VPC (full mesh), each connects only to the **TGW** — greatly reducing complexity.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Transit Gateway

- Replaces complex **VPC peering meshes**
