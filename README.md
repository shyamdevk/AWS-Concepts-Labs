## 🧱 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

> A **VPC** is a private, isolated network inside AWS where you can launch and control resources securely.

---

### 🧩 STEP 1 — CREATE A VPC

**CIDR Block:** Defines a range of IP addresses for your VPC and subnets.
🧮 Use calculator: [Subnet Calculator](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html)

#### 🧠 Components of VPC

1. **VPC:** Virtual network to host AWS resources.
2. **Subnets:** Segments of your IP range.

   * **Public Subnet** → Connected to Internet Gateway.
   * **Private Subnet** → No direct Internet access.
3. **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Enables internet connectivity.
4. **Route Table:** Controls traffic routing (to IGW or NAT).

---

### 🧩 STEP 2 — CREATE SUBNETS

* Go to **Subnets tab** → Create subnet.
* Select your VPC.
* Assign name and **CIDR Block**.
* When VPC is created → AWS auto-creates:

  * Main Route Table
  * Network ACL
  * DHCP Options Set
  * Default Security Group

#### ⚠️ Reserved IPs in Subnet

| IP Address | Usage             |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 10.0.0.0   | Network Address   |
| 10.0.0.1   | VPC Router        |
| 10.0.0.2   | DNS Address       |
| 10.0.0.3   | Future Use        |
| 10.0.0.127 | Broadcast Address |

---

### 🌐 STEP 3 — CREATE INTERNET GATEWAY

1. Go to **Internet Gateways tab** → Create IGW
2. Attach to existing VPC via **Actions → Attach to VPC**

---

### 🛣️ STEP 4 — ROUTE TABLE CONFIGURATION

1. Go to **Route Tables**
2. Select your VPC’s route table
3. Add route:

   ```
   Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
   Target: Your Internet Gateway (IGW)
   ```
4. Use **Resource Map** to visualize connections.

---

### 💻 STEP 5 — ATTACH VPC TO EC2

* While launching EC2 instance:

  * Under **Network Settings**, select your VPC & Subnet.
  * Enable Auto-assign Public IP.
  * Assign appropriate Security Group.
  * Launch instance.

---

### 🖥️ STEP 6 — CLI CONNECTION

```bash
ssh -i "C:\Users\shyam\Downloads\Test-Server-Key.pem" ec2-user@67.202.33.11
# If timeout → modify Security Group inbound rules for SSH (port 22)
```

---

### 🔒 STEP 7 — MAKE SUBNET PRIVATE

* Create **new Route Table**.
* Associate only **private subnet** with this new route table.
* Verify via **Resource Map**.

---

### 🔐 STEP 8 — CONNECT TO PRIVATE SERVER

1. SSH into **Public Server** first.
2. Copy your private key content into a file (using `vi`).
3. Save and set permission:

   ```bash
   chmod 700 <keyfile>
   ssh -i <keyfile> ec2-user@<PrivateIP>
   ```

✅ You’re now connected to the private server via public instance.

> ⚠️ Note: Public server must have internet access (IGW route in Route Table).

# ☁️ AWS Networking — NAT, Elastic IP, Firewall, and VPC Peering

> A complete guide to **AWS networking components** including **NAT Gateway**, **Elastic IP**, **NACLs**, **Security Groups**, and **VPC Peering Lifecycle**.  
> Simplified and ready for study or documentation.

---

## 🌐 NAT (Network Address Translation)

In AWS, **NAT** allows instances in a **private subnet** to access the **internet** (for updates, APIs, etc.) without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.

### 💡 Use Case
Private servers can **download updates** via NAT Gateway,  
but **remain inaccessible** from the internet.

---

### ⚙️ Steps to Access Internet from Private Server via NAT

1. Create a **NAT Gateway** from the VPC console  
2. Select your **Public Subnet**  
3. Allocate an **Elastic IP**  
4. Create the **NAT Gateway**  
5. Assign the NAT Gateway to **Private Route Table**  
6. Add a new route:
   - **Destination:** `0.0.0.0/0`
   - **Target:** NAT Gateway

✅ Done! Private instances now have **outbound internet access** without being exposed publicly.

---

## 🌍 Elastic IP (EIP)

An **Elastic IP (EIP)** is a **static, public IPv4 address** that stays permanently allocated to your AWS account.

### 📌 Key Points

- **Static:** Unlike normal public IPs (which change when you stop/start an instance), an EIP **remains the same**.  
- **Re-mappable:** You can detach it from one instance and attach it to another — useful for **failover or recovery**.  
- **Purpose:** Provides a **permanent and consistent** public IP for EC2 instances or other resources.

---

### ⚙️ Steps to Allocate and Manage Elastic IP

1. Go to **VPC → Elastic IPs → Allocate Elastic IP Address**
2. Once allocated → **Actions → Associate Elastic IP**
3. Select the **EC2 instance** and **Save**
4. After use:
   - **Disassociate** the IP  
   - **Release** it from your account  

---

## 🔥 Firewall in VPC

AWS VPC provides **two firewall layers** to control inbound and outbound traffic.

| Firewall Type | Level | Stateful | Description |
|----------------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Network ACL (NACL)** | Subnet-level | ❌ Stateless | Controls subnet traffic using numbered rules |
| **Security Group** | Instance-level | ✅ Stateful | Controls inbound/outbound traffic for EC2 |

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/1.png)
---

## 🧱 Setting Up NACL (Network Access Control List)

### ⚙️ Steps:

1. Go to **VPC → Network ACLs → Create**
2. Select your **VPC**  
3. Under **Subnet Associations**, add the subnet(s) you want  
4. Add **Inbound** and **Outbound** rules (both mandatory)  
5. Remember:
   - Lower **Rule Number** = Higher priority  
   - `*` (asterisk) = Lowest priority
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/2.png)
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/3.png)

6. Outbound traffic should allow **All Traffic** for internet access

> 🚫 Based on the configured rules and ports, the server traffic may be **allowed or denied**.

---

## 🛡️ Setting Up Security Groups

### ⚙️ Steps:

1. Go to **VPC → Security Groups → Create Security Group**
2. Add **Inbound Rules** (Outbound rules are open by default)
  ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/4.png)
4. To attach:
   - EC2 → **Actions → Security → Change Security Groups**
   - Remove the existing group  
   - Add your **new custom Security Group**

✅ Security Groups are **stateful**, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed.

---

## 🔢 Port Numbers

| Type | Range | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Total** | 0 – 65535 | All available ports |
| **Well-known Ports** | 0 – 1023 | Common services (HTTP, SSH, etc.) |
| **Registered Ports** | 1024 – 49151 | User and system applications |
| **Dynamic Ports** | 49152 – 65535 | Private/temporary connections |

---

## 🔁 VPC Peering Connection Lifecycle

Below are the stages of a **VPC Peering Connection** in AWS.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/5.png)


| State | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Initiating-request** | A VPC peering request is created by the requester |
| **Pending-acceptance** | Waiting for the accepter VPC to approve |
| **Active** | Peering successfully established |
| **Provisioning** | Connection setup in progress |
| **Deleting** | Connection is being removed |
| **Deleted** | Peering removed completely |
| **Failed** | Request could not be completed |
| **Expired** | Request not accepted in time |
| **Rejected** | Request denied by the accepter |
| **No longer visible** | Removed from console after failure/rejection |

---

## 🌉 VPC Peering Connection

**Definition:**  
A **VPC Peering Connection** enables **two VPCs** to communicate using **private IP addresses**, making them appear as if they’re on the same internal network.

---

### ⚙️ STEP 1 — Create Two VPCs

1. **VPC A:** Public + Private Subnets  
2. **VPC B:** Private Subnet only  
3. AWS automatically creates:
   - Route Tables  
   - Internet Gateway  
   - Public & Private Subnets  

Example setup:
- **VPC A:** (Public + Private Subnets)  
- **VPC B:** (Private Subnet only)

---

### ⚙️ STEP 2 — Create EC2 Instances

1. Launch **3 EC2 Instances**
   - Instance 1 → VPC A (Public Subnet)
   - Instance 2 → VPC A (Private Subnet)
   - Instance 3 → VPC B (Private Subnet)
     ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/6.png)

2. At this stage, **VPC A** and **VPC B** cannot communicate (no peering yet).

---

### ⚙️ STEP 3 — Create the Peering Connection

1. Go to **VPC → Peering Connections → Create**
2. **Requester:** VPC A (Public + Private)  
   **Accepter:** VPC B (Private only)
3. Once created → Select Peering → **Actions → Accept Request**

---

### ⚙️ STEP 4 — Update Route Tables

- **Private Route Table (VPC A):**
  - Destination: CIDR range of VPC B
  - Target: Peering Connection
    ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/7.png)


- **Private Route Table (VPC B):**
  - Destination: CIDR range of VPC A
  - Target: Peering Connection  
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/8.png)

---

### ⚙️ STEP 5 — Configure Security Groups

- Go to **EC2 → Security → Edit Inbound Rules**
- Add **ICMP (Ping)** rule to allow communication between private instances  
  (used for testing connectivity)
![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/9.png)

---

### ⚙️ STEP 6 — Verify Connection

From the **Private Instance in VPC A**, test connection to **Private Instance in VPC B:**
![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/10.png)


```bash
ping <Private-IP-of-VPC-B-instance>
````

✅ If ping succeeds, VPC Peering is active and functional.

---

## 🧠 Notes

* VPC Peering **across regions** requires **different key pairs**
* When peering **between AWS accounts**, copy the **VPC ID** of the peer account
* Both accounts must have at least **one public and one private subnet**
* Number of possible Peering Connections:

  ```
  n(n - 1) / 2
  ```

## 🔐 Key Pair & Recovery

A **Key Pair** in AWS consists of a **public key** and **private key** for secure SSH login.

- **Private Key:** Owned by the user.  
- **Public Key:** Stored inside the instance at  
```

/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys

````

---

### 🧭 Exercise: Recover EC2 When Private Key is Lost (Using a Dummy Server)

1. **Detach** volume from the main instance.  
2. **Attach** it to a **dummy instance**.
3. **Mount** main volume:
 ```bash
 sudo mount -t xfs -o nouuid /dev/xvdb1 /mnt/mount
````

4. **Copy authorized_keys:**

   ```bash
   sudo mv authorized_keys /mnt/mount/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
5. **Detach** main volume → **Reattach** to the main instance (ensure device name = root).
6. Start instance → Connect using **dummy server’s key-pair**.

✅ The main instance now accepts the dummy server’s key-pair for SSH access.

---

### 🔑 Alternate Method: Generate a New RSA Key Pair

1. Create key pair:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```
2. Generated files inside `.ssh`:

   * `id_rsa` → Private Key
   * `id_rsa.pub` → Public Key
3. Move public key to `authorized_keys`:

   ```bash
   mv test.pub authorized_keys
   ```
4. Convert key to RSA (PEM) format:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f test
   ```
5. Copy public key → Save to text file → Use it for SSH authentication.

# ⚙️ Auto Scaling in AWS

### 🧠 Definition
**Auto Scaling** automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances according to demand, ensuring consistent performance and cost optimization.

---

## 🔹 Types of Scaling

### 1️⃣ Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)
- Adds or removes **instances** based on demand.  
  Example:
  - Traffic ↑ → Add EC2s  
  - Traffic ↓ → Remove EC2s

### 2️⃣ Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)
- Changes **instance size** to increase/decrease performance.  
  Example:
  - Upgrade `t2.micro → t2.large`

---

# 🧩 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

An **ASG** manages a group of EC2 instances collectively. It automatically maintains the desired instance count.

### ⚙️ Capacity Settings

| Setting | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Minimum Capacity** | Minimum number of instances always running |
| **Maximum Capacity** | Maximum limit of instances allowed |

2. Click **Select Metric**
3. Choose:

   * **EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics**
   * Select **CPUUtilization**
   * Choose your EC2 instance
4. Click **Select Metric**

### Configure the Alarm Condition

5. Set the **Threshold type**: Static
6. Set the threshold:

   * **Greater than 50%**
7. Set **Period** to 1 minute (works well with detailed monitoring)

### Configure Notification

8. In **Notification Settings:**

   * Choose: **In Alarm**
   * Select the **SNS Topic** you created earlier (EC2-CPU-Alerts)

This means whenever CPU > 50%, CloudWatch will publish an alert to SNS.

---

# ## ✅ **Step 5: Create and Test the Alarm**

1. Review the settings
2. Click **Create Alarm**

### Testing the Alarm

To trigger CPU > 50%, you can SSH into the EC2 instance and run:

```bash
sudo yum install stress -y
stress --cpu 2
```

After a short period:

* CPU rises above 50%
* Alarm enters **ALARM** state
* CloudWatch sends the event to SNS
* SNS sends an **email notification** to your inbox

---

# ## 🎉 **Result**

Whenever your EC2 instance’s CPU exceeds **50%**, you will receive a **real-time email alert** through AWS SNS.

This lab helps you understand:

* SNS Topics and subscriptions
* CloudWatch alarms
* Automated notifications
* Monitoring EC2 instances effectively

---

## 🏁 **Objective**

* Create a managed database using **Amazon Aurora / RDS**
* Launch an EC2 instance
* Install a MySQL/MariaDB client
* Connect to the database using the DB endpoint

---

# 🚀 **STEP 1: Create the Database (Aurora / RDS)**

Follow these steps in the AWS Console:

### 🔷 **1. Go to RDS → Databases → Create Database**

You will see two creation methods:

* **Standard create**
* **Easy create**

✅ Choose **Standard create**

---

### 🔷 **2. Choose the Engine**

* Select **MySQL** (or Aurora MySQL if needed)

---

### 🔷 **3. Choose Template**

# 🌐 **Amazon Route 53**

![AWS GIF](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/route53.gif)

### ✅ **What is Route 53?**

Amazon **Route 53** is a **highly available, scalable, and global DNS (Domain Name System) service** by AWS.
It helps map **domain names → IP addresses** so users can reach websites and applications.

---

## ⭐ **Key Features**

### 🔹 **1. DNS Service**

* Converts domain name like `example.com` → IP address.
* Ensures users reach your application correctly.

### 🔹 **2. Domain Registration**

* You can **buy, manage, and transfer** domain names directly from Route 53.

### 🔹 **3. Health Checks**

* Route 53 monitors your application or server.
* If the main server fails, it automatically routes traffic to a **healthy backup**.

### 🔹 **4. Traffic Routing Policies**

Route 53 can route traffic intelligently using:

| Policy                    | Description                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Simple Routing**        | One record → one server             |
| **Weighted Routing**      | Split traffic based on weights      |
| **Latency-based Routing** | Sends user to lowest-latency region |
| **Failover Routing**      | Primary → Secondary backup          |
| **Geolocation Routing**   | Based on user’s geographic location |

---

## 📌 **Why the name "Route 53"?**

Because **DNS works on port 53**.

---

## 📝 **Short Note Summary**

**Route 53 = DNS + Domain Registration + Health Checks + Smart Traffic Routing.**

---

# 🌍 **DNS Resolution Explained**

### 🧠 **What is DNS?**

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names like `google.com` into IP addresses like `142.250.78.14`.

It’s basically the **“phonebook of the internet.”**

---

# 🔄 **DNS Resolution Flow (Step-by-Step)**

 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/dns.png)

### **1️⃣ Browser → Checks Browser Cache**

* You type `www.example.com`
* Browser checks if the IP is already stored.

---

### **2️⃣ Browser → ISP DNS Resolver**

* If not cached, browser sends query to your **ISP’s DNS Resolver** (like Airtel/Jio resolver).

---

### **3️⃣ ISP DNS Resolver → Local Cache Check**

* Resolver checks its own cache.
* If no entry → goes to the **Root Server**.

---

### **4️⃣ ISP Resolver → Root Server**

* Root server doesn’t know exact IP.
* It tells which **TLD server** to ask.

Example:
`example.com` → go to **.com TLD server**

---

### **5️⃣ TLD Server → Authoritative Name Server**

* TLD server directs resolver to authoritative nameserver for that domain.

---

### **6️⃣ Authoritative Name Server → Returns IP**

* Contains the actual DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX).
* Responds with the real **IP address**.

---

### **7️⃣ Resolver → Caches Result**

* Stores the IP temporarily (TTL: Time To Live)
* Sends IP to browser

---

### **8️⃣ Browser → Connects to Web Server**

* Browser uses IP to load website.

---

# 📘 **Complete Notes Summary**

### **Amazon Route 53**

* Manages domains + DNS + traffic routing
* Highly available and global
* Supports advanced routing (failover, weighted, latency)

### **DNS Resolution**

* Browser → DNS Resolver → Root → TLD → Name Server → Browser
* Caching improves speed
* DNS makes internet human-friendly

# 🌐 **AWS CloudFront — Hands-On Lab**

> This lab helps you understand how to deliver content using **AWS CloudFront** with an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** hosting a sample website on EC2.

---

## 📘 **Lab Overview**

In this lab you will:

1. Launch an EC2 instance with a sample webpage
2. Create a Load Balancer for the EC2 instance
3. Create a CloudFront Distribution
4. Connect CloudFront to the Load Balancer as the Origin
5. Access your website using the CloudFront global CDN URL

---

# 🏁 **Step 1 — Launch EC2 Instance With Sample Webpage**

Use the following **User Data** script when launching EC2:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

echo "<h1>Welcome to My EC2 Website</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
echo "<p>This website is served through an Application Load Balancer.</p>" >> /var/www/html/index.html
```

✔ This creates a simple webpage
✔ Apache starts automatically

---

# 🏗️ **Step 2 — Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

### Follow these steps:

1. Open **EC2 Console → Load Balancers**
2. Click **Create Load Balancer → Application Load Balancer**
3. Set:

   * **Scheme:** Internet-facing
   * **IP type:** IPv4
4. **Listeners:** HTTP (port 80)
5. **Availability Zones:** Select at least 2
6. **Target Group:**

   * Create a new target group
   * Register your EC2 instance

After creation, open the ALB **DNS name** in your browser to verify the website loads.

---

# 🌍 **Step 3 — Create CloudFront Distribution**

### Steps:

1. Open **CloudFront Console**
2. Click **Create Distribution**
3. In **Origin Domain**, choose your **Load Balancer**
4. Keep **viewer protocol policy** as:

   ```
   Redirect HTTP to HTTPS  (recommended)
   ```

   If your ALB does not support HTTPS yet → you can change this later.

---

# 🎛️ **Step 4 — (Optional Fix) Edit Origin Settings**

If your Load Balancer only supports **HTTP**, CloudFront HTTPS may fail.

To fix this:

1. Open the Distribution
2. Go to **Origins → Edit**
3. Change:

   * **Origin Protocol Policy:** HTTP Only
4. Save changes
5. CloudFront will deploy the update (takes 3–5 minutes)

---

# 🔗 **Step 5 — Access Your Website Through CloudFront**

After the distribution status shows **Enabled**, copy the CloudFront domain:

```
https://d123example.cloudfront.net
```

Paste it in your browser → your EC2 website will load from **global edge locations**.

🎉 Congratulations!
You are now serving your website using **AWS CloudFront CDN + Load Balancer + EC2**.

---

# 📝 **Summary**

| Component  | Purpose                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| EC2        | Hosts your sample webpage            |
| ALB        | Distributes traffic across instances |
| CloudFront | Serves content fast using global CDN |

CloudFront improves performance, caching, scalability, and global delivery.

# 🌐 **LAB: Host Static Website on S3 + Deliver via CloudFront (With OAC)**

> This lab teaches you how to host a static website on an **S3 bucket** and deliver it globally using **AWS CloudFront** with **Origin Access Control (OAC)**.
>
> Also includes the fix for **CSS, JS, images not loading (403 AccessDenied)** by applying the correct S3 bucket policy.

---

## 📁 **Folder Structure Example**

```
index.html
assets/
   ├── css/
   └── js/
images/
   ├── logo.png
   └── banner.jpg
```

---

# 🧪 **STEPS**

---

# ✅ **Step 1 — Create an S3 Bucket**

1. Open **AWS → S3**
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Bucket name: `buckerr989898`
4. Leave **Block Public Access ON** (required for OAC)
5. Create bucket

---

# ✅ **Step 2 — Upload Website Files**

Upload:

* `index.html`
* `assets/` folder
* `images/` folder

---

# ✅ **Step 3 — Enable Static Website Hosting**

Inside **Bucket → Properties**:

1. Enable **Static website hosting**
2. Set:

   * Index document: `index.html`
   * Error document: `index.html` (optional for SPA)

---

# ✅ **Step 4 — Create CloudFront Distribution**

1. Open **CloudFront** → **Create Distribution**
2. Origin domain → Choose the S3 bucket
3. **Origin Access Control (OAC)** → *Enable (recommended)*
4. Create distribution

---

# ✅ **Step 5 — Apply Correct S3 Bucket Policy (Fix CSS/JS/Images 403 Error)**

This policy allows **CloudFront** to load:

✔ index.html
✔ asset files
✔ image files
✔ CSS / JS / PNG / JPG / SVG

### ✔ **Final Working Bucket Policy (OAC)**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontOACAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::buckerr989898/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::526888234336:distribution/EBEJZQVVTMTHA"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

👉 **This makes everything under the bucket public to CloudFront**, including:

* `assets/css/font-awesome.min.css`
* `assets/js/*`
* `images/*`

No need to change any additional permissions.

---

# ✅ **Step 6 — Invalidate CloudFront Cache**

After updating the policy:

1. CloudFront → **Invalidations**
2. Create **new invalidation**
3. Enter:

```
/*
```

This forces CloudFront to fetch new files.

---

# ✅ **Step 7 — Test the Website**

Open the CloudFront domain:

```
https://dxxxxxx.cloudfront.net
```

Now your:

✔ CSS loads
✔ JS loads
✔ Images load
✔ Full website works 🎉

---

# 📌 **Common Issue: Only index.html Loads**

This happens when:

❌ assets/ or images/ folders are private
❌ wrong bucket policy
❌ CloudFront not authorized to read objects

The above **OAC bucket policy fixes this 100%**.

---

# 🎉 **Lab Completed Successfully**

You have now hosted a static website on **S3** and delivered it via **CloudFront** with correct permissions.

# 🌐 **LAB: Give CloudFront Access to a Private S3 Bucket & Host Website**

This lab explains **how to host a static website in a PRIVATE S3 bucket** and **allow CloudFront to access it securely using OAC (Origin Access Control)**.

---

## 🧪 **LAB NAME:**

**Host Website on Private S3 Bucket Using CloudFront (OAC)**

---

# ✅ **STEPS**

## **1️⃣ Create an S3 Bucket (Private)**

1. Go to **AWS S3 Console → Create bucket**
2. Bucket name example:

   ```
   buckerr989898
   ```
3. Keep **Block Public Access = ON** (required for private hosting)
4. Upload your files:

   * `index.html`
   * `assets/` folder (CSS/JS)
   * `images/` folder

---

## **2️⃣ Create CloudFront Distribution**

1. Go to **CloudFront Console**
2. Click **Create Distribution**
3. **Origin domain:** Choose your S3 bucket
4. Under "Origin access":

   * Select **Origin Access Control (Recommended)**
5. Save → Create distribution.

This makes CloudFront the only allowed service that can read your bucket.

---

## **3️⃣ Apply Bucket Policy to Allow CloudFront Access**

Use the policy below (this is the final working version for your case):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontOACAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::buckerr989898/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::526888234336:distribution/EBEJZQVVTMTHA"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✔ This policy allows CloudFront to read:

* `index.html`
* `assets/**`
* `images/**`
* Any future files inside the bucket

Because the `/*` wildcard covers **all folders** inside S3.

---

## **4️⃣ Disable S3 Public Access Permissions**

You **must not make your files public manually**.

Leave:

* **Bucket Public Access Block = ON**
* No public ACLs
* No public objects

CloudFront → OAC → is responsible for access.

---

## **5️⃣ Invalidate CloudFront Cache**

After uploading new files or updating the policy:

Go to:
**CloudFront → Invalidations → Create Invalidation → `/*`**

This forces CloudFront to fetch fresh content.

---

## **6️⃣ Test the Website**

Open your CloudFront domain:

```
https://dxxxxxxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net
```

Your entire website (HTML + assets + images) will now load even though the S3 bucket is **fully private**.

---

# 📝 **Summary for Notes**

### ✔ Private S3 bucket

Public access is blocked.

### ✔ CloudFront OAC

Securely accesses the bucket on your behalf.

### ✔ Bucket Policy

Allows CloudFront distribution to read all files.

### ✔ CloudFront Domain

Used to load the website.

### ✔ Static Website Hosting

Not required — CloudFront reads objects directly.

---

# 🎉 Final Output

With this configuration:

* Website loads from CloudFront
* S3 bucket stays **100% private**
* All folders (`assets/`, `images/`, etc.) work
* No 403 errors

# 📁 Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)

![AWS GIF](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/efs.gif)

Amazon **EFS** is a **fully managed, scalable, shared file storage** service for **Linux-based applications**.  
It allows **multiple EC2 instances** to access the **same files at the same time** using the **NFS protocol**.

---

## 🚀 Why EFS?
EFS works like a **shared network folder**.  
If one EC2 writes a file, **all other EC2s can immediately see it**.  
You don’t need to manage storage size — EFS **grows and shrinks automatically**.

---

## ⭐ Key Features
- 🔄 **Auto-scaling** – Storage expands with your data  
- 🤝 **Shared access** – Many EC2 instances can mount it  
- 🛡️ **Highly Available** – Data stored across all AZs  
- 🔐 **Secure** – Supports encryption at rest & in transit  
- 💼 **Fully Managed** – No servers, no maintenance  
- 💰 **Pay-as-you-go** – Pay only for the space you use  

---

## 📘 How EFS Works (Simple)
1. You create an **EFS file system** in AWS.  
2. AWS automatically creates **mount targets** in each Availability Zone.  
3. EC2 instances connect to EFS using **NFSv4** protocol.  
4. All EC2 instances share the **same data** inside EFS.

---

## 🧰 Common Use Cases
- 🌐 Web servers (Apache/Nginx) sharing the same content  
- 📝 WordPress / CMS shared uploads folder  
- 📊 Big data & analytics processing  
- 🧑‍💻 Shared home directories for multiple users  
- 📦 ECS/EKS containers needing shared storage  

---

## 🔄 EFS vs EBS (Quick Comparison)
| Feature | **EFS** | **EBS** |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Type | File storage | Block storage |
| Access | Many EC2 instances | Single EC2 |
| Scaling | Automatic | Fixed size |
| Use Case | Shared data | OS disk, DB storage |

---

## 🛠️ Basic Mount Commands (Optional)
Install NFS tools:
```bash
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils   # Amazon Linux
sudo apt install -y nfs-common  # Ubuntu/Debian
````

Create mount directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /efs
```

Mount EFS:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs4 fs-xxxx.efs.<region>.amazonaws.com:/ /efs
```

---

## 🎯 Summary

Amazon EFS is best when you need:
✔ Shared storage

# 🧪 LAB: Configure AWS EFS & Mount on Two EC2 Instances

This lab demonstrates how to **create an Amazon EFS file system**, mount it on **two EC2 instances**, and verify that **both instances can access the same shared storage**.

---

# 📌 **🎯 Objective**
- Create an **EFS File System**  
- Create **two EC2 instances**  
- Mount the **same EFS** on both instances (using different mount directories)  
- Verify **shared access** by creating a file from one instance and accessing it from the other

---

# 🏗️ Step 1 — Create EFS File System
1. Go to **EFS Console**
2. Click **Create File System**
3. Choose:  
   - ✅ *Recommended settings* (or customize if needed)  
4. Click **Create**
5. EFS file system will be created along with **Mount Targets** in each AZ.

---

# 🔐 Step 2 — Configure Security Group
To mount EFS using NFS:

### ✔ Ensure the EFS Security Group allows:
- **Inbound Rule:**  
  - *Type:* NFS  
  - *Port:* 2049  
  - *Source:* EC2 Instance Security Group

This ensures EC2 instances can connect to EFS.

---

# 💻 Step 3 — Launch Two EC2 Instances
1. Create **two Linux EC2 instances**
2. Attach them to:
   - Same VPC  
   - Same or reachable Subnets  
   - Security Groups that allow NFS communication  

---

# 📌 Step 4 — Mount EFS on EC2 Instance 1
1. Go to **EFS Console → Your EFS → Attach**
2. Choose **Mount via DNS**
3. Copy the NFS client command they provide

Example mount command:
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-06ecbb4def899ef60.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ <directory-name>
````

### Create a mount directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /efs1
```

### Mount EFS:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-06ecbb4def899ef60.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /efs1
```

---

# 📌 Step 5 — Mount EFS on EC2 Instance 2

Repeat the same steps on the **second instance**.

### Create a different directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /efs2
```

### Mount EFS:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-06ecbb4def899ef60.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /efs2
```

---

# 📁 Step 6 — Test Shared Access (Important)

### On Instance 1:

```bash
cd /efs1
sudo touch testfile.txt
sudo mkdir testfolder
```

### On Instance 2:

```bash
cd /efs2
ls
```

### 🟢 You should see:

```
testfile.txt
testfolder
```

This confirms EFS is **mounted successfully** and **shared** between both EC2 instances.

---

# ✅ **Lab Completed!**

You have successfully:

* Created an EFS File System
* Mounted it on two EC2 instances
* Verified shared file access

This setup is commonly used in:

* Load-balanced web servers
* CMS applications (WordPress shared uploads)
* Any distributed system needing shared file storage

---

# 📦 **1. Introduction to Containerization**

## 🔹 What is Containerization?

Containerization is the process of packaging an application along with all its dependencies (libraries, runtime, config files) into a lightweight, portable unit called a **container**.

### ⭐ Benefits of Containerization

* ⚡ Fast deployment
* 🧩 Works the same everywhere (no environment conflicts)
* 🔁 Easy scaling
* 🪶 Lightweight (uses less resources than VMs)
* 🚀 Portable across systems (laptop → server → cloud)

## 🐳 Docker (Most Popular Container Tool)

### 🧱 Docker Image

Blueprint of the application.

### 🟦 Docker Container

Running instance of the Docker image.

---

# 🟦 **2. What is AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)?**
 ![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/ecs.gif)

AWS ECS is a fully managed **container orchestration service** used to **run, manage, and scale Docker containers**.

Think of ECS as a service that takes care of:

* Scheduling containers
* Starting/stopping tasks
* Scaling automatically
* Load balancing your app
* Handling networking

# 📘 **AWS SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service**

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/sqs.gif)
---

## 🧭 **What is Amazon SQS?**

**Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)** is a **fully managed message queue** service that allows different parts of an application to communicate **asynchronously**.

➡️ **SQS = Temporary storage for messages until a worker processes them**

**Why use it?**

* To **decouple** microservices
* To **avoid system overload**
* To **ensure messages are never lost**

---

# 🟦 **Types of SQS Queues**

## 🔹 **1. Standard Queue (Default)**

* Supports **unlimited throughput**
* **At-least-once delivery**
* **Best-effort ordering** (not guaranteed)
* Suitable for high-scale systems
  ➡️ Use when *ordering is not important*.

## 🔹 **2. FIFO Queue (First-In-First-Out)**

* **Strict ordering** guaranteed
* **Exactly-once processing**
* Lower throughput than Standard
* Supports “**Message Group ID**” for parallel processing
  ➡️ Use when *order matters* (payments, transactions).

---

# 🚀 **How SQS Works (Simple Flow)**

1️⃣ **Producer sends message → SQS Queue**
2️⃣ SQS stores the message durably
3️⃣ **Consumer polls** the queue
4️⃣ Consumer processes the message
5️⃣ Consumer **deletes message** from queue

➡️ If not deleted, message becomes visible again after *visibility timeout*.

---

# 🔐 **Important Concepts**

### 📨 **Message**

* Max size: **256 KB**
* Can be JSON, text, XML, etc.

### ⏲️ **Visibility Timeout**

* Time during which a message stays **hidden** after being read.
* Prevents multiple workers from processing the same message.

### 📅 **Message Retention**

* How long SQS stores a message (1 min → 14 days).

### 🗳️ **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**

Failed messages (not processed after X retries) go into a **DLQ** for debugging.

### 🔁 **Long Polling**

* Waits until a message arrives (reduces empty responses).
* Cheaper & more efficient.

---

# 🛠️ **Features of SQS**

### ✔️ **Decoupling**

Connect services without direct communication.

### ✔️ **Highly Scalable**

Handles **millions of messages per second** automatically.

### ✔️ **Durable**

Messages stored across **multiple AZs**.

# 🌐 **AWS CORS – Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**

## 📘 **What is CORS?**
![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/cors.png)

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a browser security feature that decides **which websites are allowed to access your AWS resources** (like S3, API Gateway, CloudFront).

👉 If your frontend and backend are on **different domains**, the browser checks CORS.

---

# 🔍 **Why CORS Exists?**

Browsers block requests between different websites to protect users from malicious sites.
So AWS resources must explicitly say:

> **“Yes, this website is allowed to access me.”**

---

# 🟦 **When Does CORS Trigger?**

CORS is checked when:

* `frontend.com` → calls → `api.com`
* `localhost:3000` → calls → AWS API Gateway
* CloudFront → loads image from S3
* Any **cross-domain** request happens

If CORS is not allowed → browser blocks.

---

# 📌 **Important CORS Concepts**

### **1. Origin**

Origin = Protocol + Domain + Port
Example:

```
https://example.com:443
```

### **2. Access-Control-Allow-Origin**

Specifies **which websites** can access the resource.

Example (allow one site):

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com
```

Allow all sites:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### **3. Access-Control-Allow-Methods**

Allowed HTTP methods:

```
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
```

### **4. Access-Control-Allow-Headers**

What headers the frontend can send:

```
Content-Type, Authorization
```

### **5. Preflight Request**

Before sending actual data, browser sends:

```
OPTIONS request
```

to check if the server allows it.

If server responds with proper CORS headers → request continues.

---

# 🛠️ **CORS in AWS Services**

## ✔️ **1. S3 (Static Websites, Images, Files)**

To allow any website to access S3 objects:

```xml
<CORSRule>
  <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
  <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
  <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
```

If you want ONLY your site:

```xml
<CORSRule>
  <AllowedOrigin>https://mywebsite.com</AllowedOrigin>
  <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
  <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
```

---

## ✔️ **2. API Gateway (Frontend → API Calls)**

When frontend calls API Gateway, you must enable CORS.

Typical API Gateway response headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

API Gateway handles OPTIONS (preflight) automatically if CORS is enabled.

---

## ✔️ **3. CloudFront (CDN for S3/API)**

CloudFront must forward these headers to origin:

```
Origin
Access-Control-Request-Headers
Access-Control-Request-Method
```

Otherwise CORS fails even if S3/API is configured correctly.

---

# 🎯 **Simple Example to Understand**

### Frontend:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### API (AWS):

```
https://abc123.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

Since domains are different → Browser blocks by default.

To allow access, API must return:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
```

Now browser allows the request.

---

# ⚠️ **Common CORS Errors**

| Error                                     | Meaning                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header** | CORS not enabled or wrong domain             |
| **Blocked by CORS policy**                | Browser rejected the request                 |
| **Preflight request failed (OPTIONS)**    | Backend did not respond correctly to OPTIONS |

---

# 🧠 **Super Simple Summary**

* CORS = Browser permission system
* AWS services must say **which websites can access them**
* Used in **API Gateway, S3, CloudFront**
* Without CORS → Browser blocks request
* Always configure correct **origin, methods, headers**

---

# 🧪 **LAB: Access S3 Image Using CORS + Load on Button Click**

## 🎯 **Goal**

Set up an S3 bucket with correct **CORS**, **permissions**, and **public access** so a simple `index.html` file can load an image from S3 **only after pressing a button**.

---

# ✅ **Step 1: Create S3 Bucket**

1. Go to **AWS Console → S3**
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Bucket name:

   ```
   my-cors-demo-bucket-009
   ```
4. Leave all default settings
5. Click **Create bucket**

---

# ✅ **Step 2: Upload Image**

1. Open the bucket
2. Click **Upload**
3. Choose your file, example:

   ```
   image.png
   ```
4. Click **Upload**

---

# ✅ **Step 3: Fix Access Denied (Make Objects Public)**

### 🔹 Turn OFF Block Public Access

Go to:

**Bucket → Permissions → Block Public Access → Edit**

Turn off:

* Block all public access
* Block public ACLs
* Block public bucket policies

Save.

---

### 🔹 Add Public Read Bucket Policy

Go to:

**Bucket → Permissions → Bucket Policy → Edit**

Paste:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-cors-demo-bucket-009/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Save changes.

---

# ✅ **Step 4: Add Correct JSON CORS Configuration**

Go to:

**Bucket → Permissions → CORS Configuration → Edit**

Paste this:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

✔ Fixes CORS issues
✔ Lets any frontend load GET objects

---

# ✅ **Step 5: Test S3 URL**

Open your uploaded image:

```
https://my-cors-demo-bucket-009.s3.amazonaws.com/image.png
```

If the image displays → permissions and CORS are correct.

---

# ✅ **Step 6: Create index.html (Load Image on Button Click)**

Create a file named **index.html**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Load S3 Image on Button Click</title>
</head>
<body style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">

    <h2>Load Image from S3 using Button</h2>

    <button onclick="loadImage()" style="padding: 10px 20px; font-size: 16px;">
        Load Image
    </button>

    <br><br>

    <img id="s3Image" src="" alt="Image will load here" width="300"
         style="display:none; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:10px;">

    <script>
        function loadImage() {
            const imageUrl = "https://my-cors-demo-bucket-009.s3.amazonaws.com/image.png";
            const img = document.getElementById("s3Image");

            img.src = imageUrl;
            img.style.display = "block";
        }
    </script>

</body>
</html>
```

---

# ✅ **Step 7: Run the Test**

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click **Load Image**
3. You should now see the S3 image appear without errors

## 📘 **VPN in VPC**

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** in AWS securely connects your **on-premises datacenter** or **office network** to your **AWS VPC** using encrypted tunnels over the internet.
This allows both networks to communicate **as if they were within the same private network**.

---

## 🧱 **Key Components**

### **1️⃣ VPC**

Your private network inside AWS.

### **2️⃣ Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**

* AWS-side VPN endpoint
* Must be **attached to your VPC**

### **3️⃣ Customer Gateway (CGW)**

* Represents your on-premises router/firewall
* Requires a **public IP address**

### **4️⃣ VPN Connection**

* Creates the secure IPsec tunnel between CGW ↔ VGW
* AWS provides **two tunnels** for high availability

---

## 🌐 **How VPN Works (Simple Flow)**

1. Create a **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**
2. Attach the VGW to your **VPC**
3. Create a **Customer Gateway (CGW)** using your router’s public IP
4. Create a **VPN Connection** linking VGW and CGW
5. Download VPN configuration and apply it to your on-prem router
6. Traffic starts flowing **securely** through encrypted tunnels

---

## 🔑 **Why Use VPN in VPC?**

* Secure communication between **AWS and on-premises**
* Easy and fast to set up

2. Request first goes through **AWS WAF**
3. WAF checks rules inside the **Web ACL**
4. WAF decides:

   * ✔ **Allow**
   * ❌ **Block**
   * 📊 **Count (log only)**

---

## 🧪 Examples of Common Rules

### ✔ Block specific IPs

Example: Block an attacker’s IP.

### ✔ Allow only office IPs

Helpful for internal apps.

### ✔ Block SQL Injection automatically

Use AWS managed rules.

### ✔ Rate Limiting

Example: Block users sending
**more than 100 requests in 5 minutes**.

---

# 🐳 AWS ECR Lab – Push NGINX Image from EC2 & Pull Back

This lab teaches you how to:

- Pull **NGINX image** from Docker Hub  
- Configure **AWS CLI**  
- Push the image to **Amazon ECR**  
- Delete images from EC2  
- Pull the image **back from ECR**  
- (Optional) Run the container  

Everything is done using **EC2 CLI**.

---

## 📌 Prerequisites
- AWS EC2 instance (Amazon Linux or any Linux)
- Docker installed  
- AWS CLI installed  
- IAM user with ECR access  
- One ECR repository created  

---

# 1️⃣ Configure AWS CLI

Run on your EC2:

```bash
aws configure
````

Enter:

* **Access Key**
* **Secret Key**
* **Region** (ex: ap-south-1)
* **Output format** (json)

This allows EC2 to communicate with AWS services.

---

# 2️⃣ Create ECR Repository (Console Step)

Go to:

**AWS Console → ECR → Create Repository → Name: `nginx-demo`**

Copy the repository URI:

```
123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/nginx-demo
```

ECR repository will store your Docker images.

---

# 3️⃣ Pull NGINX Image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull nginx
```

Check image:

```bash
docker images
```

This downloads the official nginx image to EC2.

---

# 4️⃣ Login to AWS ECR (Important)

Use the **View Push Commands** snippet from ECR:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 \
| docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

This authenticates Docker so it can push to ECR.

---

# 5️⃣ Tag the Image for ECR

```bash
docker tag nginx:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/nginx-demo:latest
```

Tagging converts the local Docker image into an ECR-compatible format.

---

# 6️⃣ Push Image to ECR

```bash
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/nginx-demo:latest
```

The nginx image is now uploaded and stored in Amazon ECR.

---

# 7️⃣ Delete Image Locally from EC2

We remove both the DockerHub image and ECR-tagged image:

```bash
docker rmi nginx:latest
docker rmi 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/nginx-demo:latest
```

Verify deletion:

```bash
docker images
```

Now EC2 has **no nginx image**.

---

# 8️⃣ Pull Image Back from ECR to EC2

Login again (if needed):

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 \
| docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

Pull the ECR image:

```bash
docker pull 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/nginx-demo:latest
```

Confirm:

```bash
docker images
```

The nginx image is restored to EC2 — but **from ECR** this time.

---

# 9️⃣ (Optional) Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

Open EC2 Public IP → You should see the **NGINX welcome page**.

# **📘 AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)**

![Screenshot](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/dms.gif)

## 🟦 What is AWS DMS?

AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) is a fully managed service that helps you **migrate databases** from one environment to another **quickly and with very little downtime**.

It supports:

* On-premise ➝ AWS
* AWS ➝ AWS
* AWS ➝ On-premise
* One DB engine ➝ Another (Oracle ➝ MySQL)

---

## 🟩 Why Use AWS DMS?

* ✅ Easy & automated migration
* ✅ Minimal downtime
* ✅ Secure and reliable
* ✅ Supports many DB engines
* ✅ Continuous data replication
* ✅ Cost-effective

---

## ⚙️ How AWS DMS Works (Simple Flow)

1. **Create Replication Instance**
   The “middle server” that handles data movement.

2. **Configure Source Endpoint**
   Your existing/old database.

3. **Configure Target Endpoint**
   Your new database (AWS or external).

4. **Create a Migration Task**
   Choose how to move data: full load, CDC, etc.

5. **Start Migration**
   DMS copies data and continues syncing if needed.

---

## 🔁 Migration Task Types

| Type                | Meaning                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Full Load**       | Moves existing data only             |
| **Full Load + CDC** | Moves existing data + future changes |
| **CDC Only**        | Only captures ongoing changes        |

---

## 🟧 Types of Migrations

### 🔹 Homogeneous Migration

Same database engine
**Example:** MySQL ➝ MySQL

### 🔹 Heterogeneous Migration

Different engines (use with AWS SCT)
**Example:** Oracle ➝ PostgreSQL

---

## 🔐 Security in AWS DMS

* TLS encryption **in transit**
* KMS encryption **at rest**
* IAM roles for access control
* VPC security groups for network protection

---

## 💡 Common Use Cases

* Move databases from **on-prem → AWS**
* Migrate to **Aurora, RDS, Redshift**
* Region-to-region DB migration
* Database engine change (Oracle → PostgreSQL)
* Real-time data replication using CDC
* Sync DB copies for analytics or backup

---

## ⭐ Key Benefits

* Minimal downtime ✔
* Easy setup ✔
* Supports major DB engines ✔
* Reliable replication ✔
* Pay only for the replication instance ✔

This lab walks you through migrating data from a **Source MySQL RDS** to a **Target MySQL RDS** using:

* 2 EC2 Instances (Source + Target)
* 2 Self-managed RDS instances
* AWS DMS (Replication Instance, Endpoints, Migration Task)

The goal is to verify successful data movement using DMS Full Load migration.

---

# 🏗️ **Lab Architecture (High Level)**

```
EC2-Source  →  Source RDS  →  AWS DMS  →  Target RDS  →  EC2-Destination
```

---

# ✅ **1. Prerequisites**

* AWS Account
* VPC + Subnets
* Security Groups configured for MySQL (port 3306)
* IAM permissions for RDS, EC2, DMS

---

# 🛡️ **2. Networking & Security Group Setup**

Create these Security Groups:

### **SG-Source-DB**

* Allow inbound **3306** from:

  * SG-Source-EC2
  * SG-DMS

### **SG-Target-DB**

* Allow inbound **3306** from:

  * SG-Target-EC2
  * SG-DMS

### **SG-DMS**

* Allow outbound **3306** to both RDS instances.

---

# 🗄️ **3. Create Two RDS Instances (MySQL)**

1. Create **Source RDS (MySQL)**
2. Create **Target RDS (MySQL)**
3. Attach the correct DB Security Groups
4. Note the RDS endpoints

---

# 💻 **4. Launch EC2 Instances (Source & Destination)**

### **Source EC2**

Install MySQL:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y mariadb-server mariadb
```

### **Destination EC2**

Install MySQL client:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y mariadb
```

---

# 🛠️ **5. Configure Source Database & Add Sample Data**

From **EC2‑Source**:

```bash
mysql -h <source-rds-endpoint> -u <username> -p
```

Inside MySQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dms_demo;
USE dms_demo;

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  role VARCHAR(100),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO employees (name, role, salary) VALUES
('Alice','Engineer',70000.00),
('Bob','Analyst',60000.00),
('Charlie','Manager',90000.00);
```

Verify:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

---

# 🔍 **6. Validate Target RDS Access**

From **EC2-Destination**:

```bash
mysql -h <target-rds-endpoint> -u <username> -p
SHOW DATABASES;
```

(Optional) Create target DB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dms_demo;
```

---

# 🔁 **7. Create DMS Replication Instance (Single AZ)**

Go to: **AWS Console → DMS → Replication Instances → Create**

* Instance class: `dms.t3.medium`
* Multi-AZ: **No**
* Subnet group: Choose appropriate subnets
* Security group: **SG-DMS**

Wait for **Available**.

---

# 🔗 **8. Create DMS Endpoints (Source & Target)**

### **Source Endpoint**

* Type: Source
* Engine: MySQL
* SSL: None
* Provide username/password

### **Target Endpoint**

* Type: Target
* Engine: MySQL
* SSL: None

### **Run Test Connection (Both)**

Must show **Successful**.

---

# 📦 **9. Create DMS Migration Task**

Go to: **DMS → Tasks → Create Task**

### **Task Configuration**

* Task type: **Full Load**
* Source: MySQL source endpoint
* Target: MySQL target endpoint

### **Table Mapping Rule**

Add selection rule:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule-type": "selection",
      "rule-id": "1",
      "rule-name": "include-database",
      "object-locator": {
        "schema-name": "dms_demo",
        "table-name": "%"
      },
      "rule-action": "include"
    }
  ]
}
```

Create Task → **Start Task**.

---

# 🧪 **10. Verify Migration on Target RDS**

From **EC2-Destination**:

```bash
mysql -h <target-rds-endpoint> -u <username> -p
USE dms_demo;
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

✔️ Data should match source.

---

# 🩹 **11. Troubleshooting Tips**

### Test fails?

* Check SG-DMS allowed outbound 3306
* DB user must have SELECT privileges
* RDS must be reachable from DMS subnet

MySQL DMS-required permissions:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'dmsuser'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

---

# 🧹 **12. Cleanup**

To avoid costs, delete:

* DMS Replication Instance
* DMS Endpoints
* EC2 Instances
* RDS Instances

---
Here is a **well-formatted, clean, decorated `README.md`** for **AWS Lambda (Basics)**:

---

# ✨ AWS Lambda 

![AWS GIF](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/lambda.gif)

## 📘 **Overview**

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code **without managing servers**.
You only upload your function, set a trigger, and Lambda handles the rest—scaling, execution, and availability.

---

## 🚀 **Why Use AWS Lambda?**

* ⚡ **No servers to manage**
* 📈 **Auto-scaling** based on traffic
* 💰 **Pay only for execution time**
* 🔗 **Easy integration** with S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, etc.

---

## 🧠 **How Lambda Works**

1. Upload your function (your logic).
2. Set a **trigger/event** to invoke the function.
3. When the event occurs → Lambda executes automatically.
4. Output is generated & logs go to **CloudWatch Logs**.

---

# 🧩 Key Concepts

### 🔹 **Function**

Your code + configuration.

### 🔹 **Trigger (Event Source)**

Something that starts the Lambda. Examples:

* S3 file upload
* DynamoDB table update
* API call through API Gateway
* CloudWatch scheduled cron job

### 🔹 **Execution Role (IAM Role)**

Permission set that allows Lambda to access other AWS services.

### 🔹 **Memory & Timeout**

* Memory: 128MB → 10GB
* Timeout: up to 15 minutes
  Both affect performance and cost.

### 🔹 **Cold Start vs Warm Start**

* ❄️ **Cold Start** → First run after idle (slightly slower)
* 🔥 **Warm Start** → Lambda already running (fast)

---

# 🛠 Supported Runtimes

Lambda supports multiple languages:

* Python
* Node.js
* Java
* Go
* .NET
* Ruby

---

# 💵 Pricing

You pay for:

* Number of requests
* Duration (per millisecond)

**First 1 million requests per month are FREE.**

---

# 🎯 Common Use Cases

* Serverless backend APIs
* Process S3 uploads
* Send emails/notifications
* Cron jobs & automation
* IoT and real-time data processing
* Serverless websites

---
Here is your **clean, simple, beginner-friendly `README.md`** for the S3 → Lambda → CloudWatch Lab.

# AWS Lambda + S3 — Thumbnail Generator 

**Goal:** When an image is uploaded to a source S3 bucket, an AWS Lambda function resizes it and writes a thumbnail to a destination S3 bucket.
![AWS GIF](https://github.com/shyamdevk/AWS-Concepts-Labs/blob/images/resize.gif)

---

## Before you start (Prerequisites)

* An AWS account with permission to create S3, IAM, and Lambda resources.
* AWS CLI installed and configured (`aws configure`).
* Node.js (recommended) **or** Python installed locally if you want to build the deployment package.
* A terminal/command prompt (Linux/macOS: bash; Windows: WSL recommended).

---

## Lab overview (high level)

1. Create two S3 buckets: **source** (where you upload images) and **destination** (where thumbnails go).
2. Create an IAM policy and execution role for Lambda that allows S3 and CloudWatch Logs access.
3. Package the Lambda function (includes an image-resizing library such as `sharp` for Node.js or `Pillow` for Python).
4. Create the Lambda function and attach the role.
5. Configure the S3 trigger so that uploads to the source bucket invoke the Lambda.
6. Test by uploading an image and verifying the thumbnail appears in the destination bucket.
7. Clean up resources when done.

---

## 1) Create S3 buckets

**Console (quick):**

* Open Amazon S3 console → Create bucket → choose a unique bucket name (lowercase, numbers, hyphens, dots).
* Create two buckets in the same AWS Region — e.g. `my-lambda-source-bucket` and `my-lambda-dest-bucket`.

**CLI example:** (replace names & region)

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-lambda-source-bucket --region us-east-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-1
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-lambda-dest-bucket --region us-east-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-east-1
```

> Note: Keep both buckets in the same region as your Lambda function.

---

## 2) Upload a test image

**Console:** open source bucket → Upload → add a small JPG/PNG image → Upload.

**CLI:**

```bash
aws s3api put-object --bucket my-lambda-source-bucket --key test.jpg --body ./test.jpg
```

---

## 3) Create a permissions policy (JSON) for Lambda

Save this as `policy.json` (simple, limited to S3 & CloudWatch Logs):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**CLI create policy:**

```bash
aws iam create-policy --policy-name LambdaS3Policy --policy-document file://policy.json
```

---

## 4) Create an execution role for Lambda

**Trust policy `trust-policy.json`:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"},
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

**CLI commands:**

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name LambdaS3Role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
# Attach the previously created policy (replace account id in arn if needed)
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name LambdaS3Role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/LambdaS3Policy
```

> If you created the policy in the same account, replace `123456789012` with your AWS account id (or read the policy ARN from the create-policy output).

---

## 5) Create the function deployment package

You can use **Node.js + sharp** (recommended for thumbnails) or **Python + Pillow**. Below are short samples.

### Node.js (using `sharp`)

1. Create a working directory and initialize npm:

```bash
mkdir lambda-s3 && cd lambda-s3
npm init -y
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 sharp
```

2. Create `index.mjs` (sample handler — replace `us-east-1` with your region):

```js
import { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import sharp from 'sharp';
import { Readable } from 'stream';

const s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });

export const handler = async (event) => {
  const srcBucket = event.Records[0].s3.bucket.name;
  const srcKey = decodeURIComponent(event.Records[0].s3.object.key.replace(/\+/g, ' '));
  const dstBucket = srcBucket + '-resized'; // or set a fixed destination bucket name

  const getObjectResp = await s3.send(new GetObjectCommand({ Bucket: srcBucket, Key: srcKey }));
  const body = await streamToBuffer(getObjectResp.Body);

  const resized = await sharp(body).resize({ width: 200 }).toBuffer();

  await s3.send(new PutObjectCommand({ Bucket: dstBucket, Key: `thumb-${srcKey}`, Body: resized }));
  return { status: 'done' };
};

function streamToBuffer(stream) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const chunks = [];
    stream.on('data', (c) => chunks.push(c));
    stream.on('end', () => resolve(Buffer.concat(chunks)));
    stream.on('error', reject);
  });
}
```

3. Zip the contents (`index.mjs` and `node_modules`) into `deployment.zip`:

```bash
zip -r deployment.zip index.mjs node_modules
```

### Python (using `Pillow`)

1. Create a folder, install Pillow into it, and add `lambda_function.py`.

`lambda_function.py` (simple):

```python
import boto3
from PIL import Image
import io

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    src_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    src_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    dst_bucket = src_bucket + '-resized'

    obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=src_bucket, Key=src_key)
    img = Image.open(obj['Body'])
    img.thumbnail((200, 200))

    out_buffer = io.BytesIO()
    img.save(out_buffer, format='JPEG')
    out_buffer.seek(0)

    s3.put_object(Bucket=dst_bucket, Key='thumb-' + src_key, Body=out_buffer, ContentType='image/jpeg')
    return {'statusCode': 200}
```

2. Create a deployment package (zip) that includes `lambda_function.py` and the `Pillow` library files.

> Packaging tip: For Python, install dependencies into a folder (`pip install Pillow -t .`) and zip the folder contents.

## 6) Create the Lambda function (Console or CLI)

**Console:** Lambda → Create function → Author from scratch → name `CreateThumbnail` → runtime (Node.js 18.x or Python 3.x) → Execution role: Use existing role `LambdaS3Role` → Create. Then upload the `deployment.zip` under Function code.

**CLI example (Node.js):**

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
  --function-name CreateThumbnail \
  --runtime nodejs18.x \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LambdaS3Role \
  --handler index.handler \
  --zip-file fileb://deployment.zip
```

> Replace ARNs and filenames as needed.

## 7) Configure S3 to invoke Lambda (add trigger)

**Console:**

* Open source bucket → Properties → Event notifications → Create event notification.
* Set event types: `PUT` (All object create events).
* Destination: Lambda function → choose `CreateThumbnail` → Save.

**CLI:** you can use `aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration` (console is easier for beginners).

---

## 8) Test the Lambda function

1. Upload an image to the source bucket (console or `aws s3 cp`):

```bash
aws s3 cp ./test.jpg s3://my-lambda-source-bucket/test.jpg
```

2. Check the destination bucket for `thumb-test.jpg` or `thumb-<original>`.
3. If something fails, open CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function to view the error traces.

**Optional:** In the Lambda console you can also run a dummy test event (use the S3 PUT event template) to run the function without uploading.

---

## 9) Clean up (avoid extra charges)

* Delete Lambda function
* Delete IAM role & policy
* Delete S3 buckets and objects

**CLI quick cleanup** (be careful):

```bash
aws lambda delete-function --function-name CreateThumbnail
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name LambdaS3Role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/LambdaS3Policy
aws iam delete-role --role-name LambdaS3Role
aws iam delete-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/LambdaS3Policy
aws s3 rm s3://my-lambda-source-bucket --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://my-lambda-source-bucket
aws s3 rm s3://my-lambda-dest-bucket --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://my-lambda-dest-bucket
```

---

## Troubleshooting & tips

* **Permissions errors:** Check that the Lambda execution role has the `LambdaS3Policy` attached and that the role trust policy allows `lambda.amazonaws.com` to assume it.
* **Region mismatch:** Make sure S3 buckets and Lambda are in the same AWS Region.
* **Large dependencies:** `sharp` or `Pillow` can bloat the zip. For production, consider Lambda Layers to share heavy libraries.
* **Testing locally:** Use `aws lambda invoke` to run the function from CLI with a sample event JSON.
